This is version 1.1 of the Climatically Heightened but Anthropogenically Achieved Historical Kerplunk (CHAAHK) spatial simulation model. 
This model was originally introduced in my masters thesis "CHAAHK: A Spatial Simulation Model of the Maya Elevated Core Region", and,
despite some updates, 1.1 very closely represents the original formulation. These updates and their effects on the simulation's results
are summarized in "Addendum to “CHAAHK: A Spatial Simulation Model of the Maya Elevated Core Region”. Both the original thesis and 
later addendum are available on the author's website https://spatialawareness.blog/ as well as at
